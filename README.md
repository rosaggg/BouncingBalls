# BouncingBalls
Edge detection bouncing ball exercise.

> A simple exercise to get you started in edge detection animation.

## Installation
Download the html file and open in your browser.

## Usage
Watch the ball move in the x and y directions and bounce back.

## Roadmap
Hope to add more variety in the balls bouncing in different directions, change random colors, and add other upgrades as more knowledge is gained.
